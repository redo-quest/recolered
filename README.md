**What is Recolor?**
Recolor is both the first 3rd-party extension for Blueprint and the first Blueprint theme.

**Does it work in combination with other extensions?**
Blueprint allows themes to work with other extensions without hassle, no custom coding required.

**Is Recolor open source?**
Recolor is both free and open source. You are welcome to fork the codebase and make your very own theme from it. Check Recolor out on [GitHub](https://github.com/sp11rum/recolor).

**How to install Recolor?**
You'll need an installation of Blueprint before being able to install this theme. Learn more about Blueprint over on [ptero.shop](https://ptero.shop). Once you have Blueprint installed, just drag and drop the `recolor.blueprint` file over to your `/var/www/pterodactyl` directory and run `blueprint -install recolor`.
